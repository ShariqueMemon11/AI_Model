**Emotion Detection Model**

**Overview**

This project involves training an AI model to identify emotions from textual data. The dataset used contains 27,000 customer support responses, which include labeled intents, making it ideal for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The model leverages the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) architecture to classify the emotional intent of input text.

**Dataset**

Dataset Source: Bitext Customer Support LLM Chatbot Training Dataset
Description: The dataset contains labeled responses for various intents in customer support scenarios. It is used to train the model to understand and classify different emotional states or intents.
Project Highlights

Data Preprocessing

Loaded the dataset using pandas.
Encoded labels using LabelEncoder for model compatibility.
Tokenized the text inputs using the AutoTokenizer from Hugging Face Transformers.
Model Architecture

Used bert-base-uncased pre-trained model for sequence classification.
Configured the model to handle a multi-class classification problem with the number of labels derived from the dataset.
Training

Split the dataset into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets.
Defined training arguments using TrainingArguments for optimal hyperparameter configuration.
Trained the model using the Hugging Face Trainer API.
Evaluation

Evaluated the model's performance after every epoch on the validation dataset.
Configured to load the best-performing model at the end of training.
Inference

Enabled emotion detection for new input text by tokenizing the input and using the trained model to predict the corresponding intent.

python
Copy
Edit
test_text = "give me refund"
inputs = tokenizer(test_text, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=128)
outputs = model(**inputs)
predicted_class = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=1).item()
print(f"Predicted Intent: {label_encoder.inverse_transform([predicted_class])[0]}")

**Results**
The model predicts the intent or emotion behind a given text with high accuracy. It is particularly useful for customer support scenarios to automate the classification of customer concerns and emotional states.
